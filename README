A C Vulkan based game engine. Primarily written in C99. Freetype, SDL and Vulkan are the only dependancies (use git submodule).
There are still some things like main.cpp left in C++ that I'll move when I get the time (I don't like C++, it's good for writing code fast but it's just ugly).
I'll probably also move away from CMake. I just don't like it.
Oh btw I know README isn't the place for this sheet but it's not like anyones going to be stumbling on this.
Active development of a game is being done on the "NV" branch. It's supposed to be a very retro 2D platformer but we'll see.
