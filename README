A C Vulkan based game engine. Primarily written in C99. Freetype, SDL and Vulkan are the only dependancies (use git submodule).
You also need to compile the font using fontc (which is built by the project as well). This will output a ./bakedfont file that The engine will use.
I'll get to adding a list to easily reference fonts when I get to it.
Oh btw I know README isn't the place for this sheet but it's not like anyones going to be stumbling on this.
Active development of a game is being done on the "NV" branch. It's supposed to be a very retro 2D platformer but we'll see.
